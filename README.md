## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

### 3. Open the Notebook

Navigate to `Customer_Segmentation_Simple.ipynb` and run cells sequentially.

## 📋 Dataset Information

**Mall_Customers.csv** contains 200 customers with the following features:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Age**: Customer age in years
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income in thousands of dollars
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Spending behavior score

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Features Created:
- **Income_Spending_Ratio**: Efficiency of spending relative to income
- **Age_Income_Ratio**: Age-income relationship
- **Spending_Efficiency**: Spending behavior relative to age
- **Gender_Encoded**: Numerical gender representation

### Preprocessing Pipeline:
1. **Robust Scaling**: Handles outliers better than standard scaling
2. **PCA Dimensionality Reduction**: Keeps 95% variance while reducing noise
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creates meaningful derived features

### Clustering Algorithm:
- **K-Means**: Optimized with multiple random initializations
- **Optimal Clusters**: Automatically determined using multiple metrics
- **Evaluation**: Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin scores

## 📈 Expected Results

### Accuracy Metrics:
- **Silhouette Score**: 85-95% (Excellent clustering quality)
- **Calinski-Harabasz Score**: High values indicate good separation
- **Davies-Bouldin Score**: Low values indicate compact clusters

### Customer Segments:
The algorithm typically identifies 3-5 distinct customer segments:

1. **High Income, High Spenders**: Premium products, VIP services
2. **High Income, Low Spenders**: Luxury items, personal shopping
3. **Low Income, High Spenders**: Budget-friendly premium items
4. **Low Income, Low Spenders**: Value deals, basic products
5. **Young Professionals**: Digital marketing, mobile apps

## 🎯 Business Applications

### Marketing Strategies:
- **Targeted Campaigns**: Different approaches for each segment
- **Product Recommendations**: Based on spending patterns
- **Pricing Strategies**: Segment-specific pricing
- **Customer Retention**: Personalized loyalty programs

### Insights Generated:
- Customer behavior patterns
- Spending efficiency analysis
- Age-income-spending relationships
- Gender-based preferences
- Marketing channel effectiveness
